#Ajax Sum

Add the values of the results from 2 ajax calls and return the value.

First time I tried it, I decided to use a setTimeout before returning the sum value to ensure that the values were added.

After thinking about it some more, I decided to implement using a helper function that would be called only when both values are set. Both implementations included in sum.js.
